# Brain-Tumor-Classification💻👨‍⚕️💊🧠
One can find all of the source code required for *classifying/detecting* brain tumors.
<br>The *deep-learning model* is built using ***Keras*** library building ***CNN-Architeture***.
<br>It is supported at *backend* by ***Fast-API*** and ***tf-serving***.
<br>The intiuative and imersive *UI/frontend* is built using ***React.js*** with ***Material-UI***.
<br>This all makes my *full-stack web-application* capable of classifying brain-tumors by letting users to upload the **MRI** scan of brain at getting results at their finger-tips.
<br>
<br>
<br>The **saved-models** were not being pushed to the repository due to its larger size of **(128MB)** so if one wants to experiment the above code can download that folder with the link attached here: <ins><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dGcgSi_bIb-CEQm34EJObjob7SqMCIvO?usp=share_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">click here</a></ins>
